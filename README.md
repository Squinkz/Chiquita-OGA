### Theme Notes

This theme is specifically designed for 480x320 resolution - it may not and probably will not work correctly on other resolutions/aspect ratios.

For optimal experience it is recommended to turn off the On Screen Help Bar and set transitions to instant.
Carousel transitions may be turned on or off depending on preference.
